Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Piotr Larkowski and I am looking for a job in the IT industry.

I am currently developing sample projects that can be found on my GitHub. (https://github.com/PiotrLarkowski)
To deal with the problems I have in my projects, I use instructional videos about programming and read books.

Looking for a job in Krakow or remote work as a Junio Java Developer.
Do you have a job at the company for me?
Please contact me ðŸ˜„
